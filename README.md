# Visual Altimeter

README is still under development

## Project Vision

Currently, Drones measure the altitude using GPS, barometers, or internal navigation systems. The goal of this project investigates the ability to use a Drone's camera footage as an altitude measurement. Our findings will be documented below

## Project Requirements

POC Model:
- Requirements: Windows or Linux OS' are able to collect images in Airsim
- Python 3.6+
- Define image amount: 10000
- Define splitsize: 80/20
- Define each images size: 224x224
- Define grayscale or color: grayscale
- Define number of classes: 3
Experiment and Scale model

## Project Set-Up

The project will have 


### 1. Documentation

- Record and explore ability and limitations of this project
- Maintain and document everything for Github repo
- View other repos with excellent READMEmd files
- Ensure environments are documented
- document Project Requirements, Computer Environment Requirements, and How to use Repo etc.
- Ensure there is a structure for all final code
- Review code for Data Collection and Model Building

### 2. Data Collection

- Utilize the AirSim environment to create and label image data for training
- Optimize data collection process
- Document code and Time it takes to run

### 3. Build Model 

- Set up small scale(few images) POC for a Resnet50 in keras
- Keras or Pytorch
- 1000 images (224x224)
- Define/Visualize Measurement Process
- Optimize any preprocessing or model steps
- Document Code
