AirSim Python Notes:

(1) Here are instructions for installing airsim in python:

	(a) uninstall all instances of python, anaconda, pip, ...
	(b) install the 64 bit version ov Anaconda
	(c) open the Anaconda Powershell Pompt and type: conda install pip
	(d) from the Anaconda Powershell Pompt type: python -m pip nstall airsim

(2) next, download an environment. AirSim environments can be downloaded here:

https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/releases

Then click on v1.2.2 - Windows, scroll down, and download an environment.
A good one to start with is one of the smaller ones, like Coastline.

(3) in order to control the drone from python, you must first run an environment
*.bat file, for example, go to

	C:\Users\chilton\Dropbox\a_Research_Active\AFIT\environments\Neighborhood

and run the run.bat file, then you should be able to run the testing_drone.py file
(or computer_vision_test.py) to connect to the API, control the vehicle,
collect data, etc.

(4) If you lose the cursor, that is because it has been captured by the environment
file. To regain control of the cursor, hit <window> key.

(5) The msgpack-rpc-python and msgpack-python package (and related packages) need
to be installed as admin (?), which can be done by typing <windows> - x, and
selecting Windows PowerShell Admin.

5) need to make a connection with the documentation:
	https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/docs/apis/

6) need to figure out how to collect/save video:
	https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/docs/image_apis/
